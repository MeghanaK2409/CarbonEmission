### Carbon emissions are a major contributor to global climate change, making accurate prediction essential for effective mitigation strategies. This project leverages ensemble learning methods such as including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Stacking to enhance predictive accuracy. This involves collecting historical carbon emission data from sources, preprocessing, and applying ensemble techniques to build a robust predictive model. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score are used to assess performance.
