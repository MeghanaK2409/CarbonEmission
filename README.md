# Carbon emissions are a major contributor to global climate change, making accurate prediction essential for effective mitigation strategies. Traditional machine learning models often struggle with complex, non-linear relationships in emission data. This project leverages ensemble learning methods such as including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Stacking to enhance predictive accuracy. The study involves collecting historical carbon emission data from reliable sources, preprocessing it for consistency, and applying ensemble techniques to build a robust predictive model. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score are used to assess performance.
